# LINKS to internship Jupyter Notebooks
Below all hyperlinks to jupyter notebooks provided with a short summary of their content:
- [2nd conf-call Nizza-Milano Jupyter notebook](./2nd-conf-call-report.html): 
  - change log:
    - changed training set generator function x domains;
    - introduced RMSE;
    - changed how the error is computed: avg weights and then compute the error over the whole training set;
    - added test descriptor feature (`.descriptor.txt`);
    - added `setup.pkl`;
  - simulation useful informations:
    - the meaning of _iteration_;
    - how the time taken by a node to perform a task is computed.
  - test 003:
    - main changes from test 002:
      - diam-expander loses one edge;
      - added root expander;
      - at the moment more tests on GD than SGD;
    - explained all simulation parameters;
    - GD tests with 100, 1k, 10k and 100k samples;
    - SGD tests with 100 and 1k samples;
  - theoretical point of view:
    - how much nodes' degree matters in speed gain;
    - how much graph's diameter matters in speed gain;
    - __iteration speed lower bound__;
