    "Let $d(u,v)$ be the \"directed\" distance from $u$ to $v$, e.g. the minimum amount of directed edges one needs to cross in order to go from $u$ to $v$ (obviously edges can be crossed just in the proper direction), then:\n",

Therefore is legit assuming that right now node $u$ is starting iteration $t$ and nodes at distance $l$ from $u$ are starting iteration $t-l$ for all $l \\leq d$.\n",

    "- but nodes at distance 1 from $u$ cannot start iteration $t$ since their still waiting their parents for their outcomes (e.g. nodes at distance 2 from $u$ haven't performed iteration $t-1$ yet); the same for nodes at distance 2 from $u$: they are waiting their parents, and so on up to nodes at distance $d$ from $u$, a straggler belongs to them, it is slowing down the whole computation.\n",

    "In this case, the time taken by the slowest node at distance $d$ is distributed as $max \\{X_1,...,X_n\\}$ (where $X_i \\sim Exp(\\lambda)$ and $n$ is the total amount of computational units) since it is . After waiting this time a chain of calculations starts up to nodes at distance 1 from $u$, and after they have finished their computations, then $u$ can go on to the next iteration. The time taken by the slowest node at distance $d-1$ from $u$ is distributed as $max \\{ X_1,...,X_{(n-\\frac{n}{d})}\\}$. In general, the time taken by the slowest node at distance $l$ from $u$ is distributed as $max \\{ X_1,...,X_{\\frac{n}{d}(d-l)}\\}$. So the time $u$ have to wait to start iteration $t$ is distributed as \n",
